Use this section to upload the course syllabus. The syllabus must conform to the Guidelines for Syllabi (see: (<a href="http://www.vpac.umd.edu/policies.html#syllabi" target="_blank">http://www.vpac.umd.edu/policies.html#syllabi</a>) or the course will not be approved. Departments are encouraged to use the course proposal process as an opportunity to ensure that syllabi include reminders about academic integrity, information for students with disabilities, early warning grades, and inclement weather policies. A list of recommended components is available through the Office of the Associate Provost for Faculty Affairs (<a href="http://faculty.umd.edu/teach/syllabus.html" target="_blank">http://faculty.umd.edu/teach/syllabus.html</a>).<br><br>
Along with learning outcomes (which should be entered in the Learning Outcomes section of the proposal), VPAC will be particularly interested in these syllabus components: the course assessment policy, required texts and other resource materials; and the pedagogy, format, and structure of the course.<br><br>
Additional documents may also be uploaded.<br>',1)
